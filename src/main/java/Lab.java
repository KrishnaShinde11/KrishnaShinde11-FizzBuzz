     * Return "Fizz" if a number n is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both.
     *
     * This is coding problem that will make use of the modulus (%) operator, which can help us calculate if a number
     * is perfectly divisible by another number.
     * The modulus operator returns the remainder after a division (eg 8%3=2).
     *
     * If you try to copy answers from the internet, you will probably get this challenge wrong. The premise is
     * slightly simpler than the classic fizzbuzz problem.
     *
     * @param n the number that will determine the fizzbuzz result.
     * @return if a number is divisible by 3, return 'Fizz'. if a number is divisible by 5, return 'Buzz'. If
     * divisible by both, return 'FizzBuzz'. If none of these are true, return a blank string "".
